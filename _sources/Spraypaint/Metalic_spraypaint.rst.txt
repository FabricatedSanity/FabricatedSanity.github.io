I would reccomend using this on items of a similar colour scheme as even after 4 coats the original colour still shines through. 
Although if you are looking for a very sparkly metalic silver this is great. Something to note is that it also creates a thin layer 
that sticks to everything if there is any overflow in your work area. Which can ruin crisp edges.
This also applies to the other colours from colourworks which are metallic.







**Biltema color**

If you want good coverage this is the spraypaint for you. It covers great, and only needs 1-2 layers for complete coverage,
even on dark colours like black. This also applies to the gold variant of this spraypaint.
