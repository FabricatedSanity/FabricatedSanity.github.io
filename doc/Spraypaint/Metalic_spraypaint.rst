**Metallic silver colourworks**

I would reccomend using this on items of a similar colour scheme as even after 4 coats the original colour still shines through. 
Although if you are looking for a very sparkly metalic silver this is great. Something to note is that it also creates a thin layer 
that sticks to everything if there is any overflow in your work area. Which can ruin crisp edges.
This also applies to the other colours from colourworks which are metallic.
