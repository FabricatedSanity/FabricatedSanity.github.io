# FabricatedSanity 🧠⚙️  
*A collective experiment in staying sane through making things.*

Welcome to our shared workshop — a space where we document what we learn, build, and occasionally break.  
From 3D printing and laser cutting to epoxy, sanding, and surface finishing, this is our evolving collection of notes, experiments, and settings.

## 🧰 What you’ll find here
- 🖨️ 3D printing profiles and material settings  
- 🔥 Laser cutting parameters for different materials  
- 🧴 Paint and epoxy recipes  
- ⚙️ Tool references and workshop tricks  
- 📖 Personal notes, projects, and random insights

## 💡 Philosophy
We believe that building things — and documenting the process — is how we learn best.  
Sometimes it’s messy, sometimes it’s genius, but it’s always *ours*.  

---

## 👥 Contributors
This is a shared effort by a small group of makers and mechatronics students  
who balance deadlines, coffee, and fabrication chaos.
